   STATE SPACE: State Space is an 8 tuple (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h).
                Each element of the tuple represents the column number of the queen in the row which is equal to it's index in the tuple.
                0<=a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h<8
   INITIAL STATE: At the start position none of the queens have been placed so the initial state is (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
                  i.e. a=b=c=d=e=f=g=h=0  
                  
   COST : One per move               
   GOAL STATE: All queens are at non attacking positions.
